Description
-----------
Just some scripts that have helped me in the past that I thought I'd share. Each should have its own usage.

shclient/shserver
-----------------
A simple remote access tool that passes and executes commands to a remote client. I'll get around to adding a usage statement at some point.
**Running shclient/shserver**
 shserver.py bind_ip bind_port 
 shclient.py server_ip server_port sleep_value_sec
